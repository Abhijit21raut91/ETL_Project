First Part

1.	Read files from a directory
2.	For each file read contents of the file
3.	Capitalize the contents of the file 
4.	Then write the capitalized content into another output file with the same name in a different directory

Second Part:

•	Read all the unique words from the file
•	For each word calculate the word count 
o	For eg: for a file containing the content
“Hello world, hello”
In this case the summary would be 
hello -> 2
world -> 1
•	For simplicity cases should be ignored – Hello and hello mean the same word
•	This summary should then be added to an output file with the same name in a different directory
